## Solutions to various small coding excercises in Swift 5 take from
* Simple & Medium practice section from CodeChef
* Facebook sample interview questions

## My usual workflow
* Write tests for the problem 
    - helps identify input and output types and gives
    - gives time to think about the edge cases of the problem
* Create a new file with a camel cased name of the problem solved
* Add the link to the problem statement on top
* Write a pure function to solve the problem
* Run with `swift test`
